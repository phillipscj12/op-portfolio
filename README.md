# The Gaming Room Software Design Document

## Client Overview
The client, **The Gaming Room**, is a gaming company that specializes in developing virtual games. They wanted a software design for a cross-platform gaming application to manage a multiplayer trivia game. Their requirements included creating a scalable solution that works on mobile and desktop devices while maintaining smooth performance and secure data handling.

## Project Reflection
- **What I Did Well**: I effectively documented the requirements and created a clear and concise design plan. This included detailed diagrams and flowcharts, which made it easier to visualize the structure of the application.
  
- **Helpful Aspects of the Process**: Working through the design document helped me better understand the client’s requirements and plan the structure of the code before development. It was particularly helpful for outlining how different components would interact.
  
- **What I Would Revise**: If I were to revise any part of the document, I would improve the user interface (UI) design section by providing more specific mockups or prototypes to better represent the user experience.

- **User Needs and Implementation**: I interpreted the user’s needs by breaking down the requirements into actionable items and translating them into the design. For instance, the need for scalability was implemented by proposing a microservices architecture. Considering user needs is critical for ensuring the final product is both functional and user-friendly.

- **Approach to Software Design**: I approached the design by following the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and breaking the project into smaller, manageable components. In the future, I would continue to use UML diagrams, flowcharts, and Agile principles to analyze and design similar applications.

## Value to Future Employers
This project demonstrates my ability to design scalable, secure, and user-focused software applications. Future employers can see my capability to understand client requirements, document solutions effectively, and prepare a clear design for implementation.
